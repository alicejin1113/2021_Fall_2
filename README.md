Nowadays, Discount Marketing is widely used strategy for companies to offer effective promotions to their customers to both attract new customers and retain existing customers. Furthermore, used effectively coupons can not only assist with customer growth and retention but can also lead to additional customer spending. 

In our dataset, the company ABC has outsourced our team to utilize machine learning techniques to assist them in bettering their discount marketing process and thus enable them the ability to accurately develop targeted marketing strategies by predicting coupon redemption. By utilizing the historical data and performance of 18 previous campaigns, we will aim to predict whether a customer will redeem a coupon or not in future campaigns (data is provided), thus guiding an effective discount marketing strategy for the company.
